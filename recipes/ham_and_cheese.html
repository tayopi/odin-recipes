    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        Some people are very passionate about the names they give
        their sandwiches. While I called this sandwich a Ham and
        Cheese Melt, some might call it a Grilled Cheese with Ham and
        Pickles. But they might find themselves on the business end
        of an earful about sandwich names. You see, there are Grilled
        Cheese Purists out there who insist that a grilled cheese must
        consist of nothing more than bread, butter, and cheese. As soon
        as you add more ingredients, they say, the sandwich is no longer
        a grilled cheeseâ€”it becomes a melt.
    </p>
    <p>
        On the other hand, others insist that as long as it is a cheesy
        sandwich fried in a pan, it remains a grilled cheese, It's simply
        an enhanced grilled cheese. If I add a spoiler to my station
        wagon, they argue, does it cease to be a station wagon? If I put
        clothes on my baby, they say, does it cease to be a baby? What
        if that baby grows into a teenager, is it still not a baby?
    </p>
    <p>
        It's best not to get involved in these arguments. Instead, before
        serving a grilled cheese or melt, ask everyone in the room what
        they prefer to call it. Anyone who cares what it's called doesn't
        get a sandwich.
    </p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 tablespoon salted butter, softened</li>
        <li>2 slices bread</li>
        <li>1 cup shredded cheddar cheese</li>
        <li>2 slices smoked ham</li>
        <li>1 medium dill pickle, thinly sliced lengthwise</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons honey mustard</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Preheat a medium skillet over medium heat. Butter each slice
            of bread on one side and place one slice butter side down in the pan.
            then sprinkle on half the cheddar. Lay the ham on top of that, then
            sprinkle the rest of the cheese on top of that.
        </li>
        <li>
            Add the second piece of bread. butter side up, cover, and cook
            for 2 to 3 minutes, until the bottom slice is golden brown, then flip
            the sandwich, replace the cover, and cook for 1 to 2 minutes more,
            until the second side is golden brown.
        </li>
        <li>
            Remove the sandwich from the pan, slide a fork between the
            2 slices of ham, and lift up the top. Add a layer of dill pickles, spread
            honey mustard on the top side, then put the sandwich back together.
        </li>
        <li>
            Cut the sandwich in half and eat it using the hole that's in your
            face. The one above your chin. Not the ones above your mouth.
        </li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Notes</h3>
    <p>
        Did you know that some people spread mayonnaise on the
        outside of the bread when pan-frying a sandwich instead of
        butter? Resist the impulse to judge, consider that they might
        know something you don't, and then allow the disdainful
        feelings to wash over you like a haughty baptismal ceremony.
    </p>
    <p>
        The mayonnaise adds a tangy flavor and produces beautiful
        golden crustitude. That's on account of the ingredient "tang"
        that is in all mayonnaises. Using butter adds a buttery flavor.
        That's because of the butter. Maybe you should give the
        mayonnaise a try. Or maybe you'd prefer to never evolve
        and spend the rest of your life barely living in your small,
        small world.
