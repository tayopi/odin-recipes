    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>The Gas Station Charcuterie Plate is possible because we live
        in the golden age of mobile snacking. It is also bound to be a hit
        because of the human tendency to equate variety with quality.
        Which is not to say the foods at gas stations are of low quality.
        It's just easy to take for granted the fact that you can get food,
        on a whim. at any time of the day or night. at these lonely fossil
        fuel outposts. In the future. a mobile rest stop subscription
        service will pull up beside you while you'rc driving, refuel your
        car, give you snacks, and let you use the restroom. all at 65 miles
        per hour. And the fuel will be laser beams.
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>Washer fluid</li>
        <li>Gasoline of your choice</li>
        <li>Pepperoni sticks</li>
        <li>Almonds</li>
        <li>Beef jerky</li>
        <li>Cheese</li>
        <li>Roasted almonds</li>
        <li>Salted pistachios</li>
        <li>Honey-roasted peanuts</li>
        <li>Barbecue peanuts</li>
        <li>Pumpkin seeds</li>
        <li>Sunflower seeds</li>
        <li>Dark chocolate</li>
        <li>Any other interesting snacks you can find at the gas station</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Pop the hood Of your car and locate
            your washer fluid reservoir (normally a
            translucent white tank with a water symbol
            on the cap). Remove the cap and add washer
            fluid until the reservoir is full, Replace the
            cap and close the hood.
        </li>
        <li>Fill your gas tank with gas.</li>
        <li>
            Go inside the store with
            actual money like it's the Old-
            fashioned days. Locate any
            interesting snacks and purchase
            them. and don't forget to pay for
            the gas and washer fluid, Drive
            home and wash the gasoline off
            your hands.
        </li>
        <li>Cut the pepperoni sticks into bite-sized pieces, Cut them at an angle if you're feeling extra fancy.</li>
        <li>
            Arrange all the snacks on a plate. platter. or serving board in
            a way that makes sense. such as grouping nuts and meats together,
            or putting nuts and meats as far away as possible from each other.
            Serve, and never tell your date where the snacks came from.*
        </li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Notes</h3>
    <p>
        *Actually, you should tell the truth about
        where the snacks came from. If you don't,
        and it's a first date, your relationship will be
        built on a bed of lie. But if you end up having
        a long relationship that ends poorly, in
        the middle of a fight, you can scream "WELL
        THOSE SNACKS WERE FROM THE GAS
        STATION ANYWAY!"
    </p>
    <p>
        The Gas Station Charcuterie Plate can also
        be constructed with from a pharmacy,
        bodega, newsstand, or if you're really desperate
        , grocery store. You're just looking for
        a good balance of snacks with contrasting
        textures and flavors. You're just looking for
        good balance of snacks with complimentary
        colors and personalities. You're just looking
        to tap deeply into humanities' long lineage
        of foraging to make best of a not even
        remotely difficult situation.
