    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        This is not the kind of potato salad you want to bring to a
        funeral. A funeral is about paying respect to the dead. And this
        potato salad would be a disrespectful gesture because it would
        pull all of the attention away from the person who died and
        place it on the potato salad instead. You could try to sneak it in,
        play it down, disguise it as a mediocre potato salad, but don't.
        It's not worth the risk. Everyone will be upset about how good
        it tastes and about how the person you were supposed to be
        celebrating couldn't possibly live up to how good it looks. So
        save this one for a potluck, OK?
    </p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 table spoon fine sea salt</li>
        <li>1 1&frasl;2 pounds mini potatoes, halved or quartered</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>For the dressing</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>4 scallions, finely chopped</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons olive oil</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon red wine vinegar</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon whole-grain mustard</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon honey</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>For the salad</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>4 medium dill pickles, diced</li>
        <li>3&frasl;4 cup chopped or sliced salami or sausage</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            In a large saucepan, add the salt. the potatoes, and enough
            water to cover them by 2 inches. Bring to a boil over high heat, then
            reduce the heat to medium and simmer for about 10 minutes, until
            fork-tender. Drain the potatoes and transfer them to a large bowl.
        </li>
        <li>
            Meanwhile. make the dressing: In a small bowl, measuring
            cup, container, or mug, combine the scallions, olive oil, red wine
            vinegar, whole-grain mustard, and honey and wangjangle.
        </li>
        <li>
            Assemble the salad: Give the dressing a final wangjangling
            before you pour it onto the potatoes (or if you prefer, wongjongling
            works well for this dressing). Add the pickles and salami, and mix until
            well combined. Serve with the residual warmness of the potatoes or
            allow the salad to cool in the fridge first. It's good either way.
        </li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Notes</h3>
    <p>
        When boiling potatoes, you have to trust the fork. The fork is the
        ultimate determiner of doneness, and once it slides through easily,
        the potatoes are done. Also, the potatoes will cooking from
        the residual heat once removed from the water, so "almost done"
        is often "done."
    </p>
    <p>
        Allowing the scallions to soak in the dressing helps the scallion-y
        flavor to pervade the dressing. You can also mash the scallions
        against the side of your dressing vessel with a fork to really increase
        the scallionness of the dressing. Don't confuse dressing scallionness
        With The Dressing Scalioness, the most powerful and fierce scallion
        in all of Dressingland.
    </p>
    <p>
        For a vegetarian version, simply pick out the bits of salami once the
        potato salad has cooled.
